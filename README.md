COVID-19 Detection Using Chest CT Scan Images

ðŸ“Œ Project Overview

This project aims to detect COVID-19 using chest CT scan images by leveraging deep learning techniques. I use a Convolutional Neural Network (CNN) model to classify images and provide predictions based on the input data.

ðŸ›  Technologies Used

Python
Flask (Backend API)
OpenCV (Image Processing)
NumPy
PyTorch (Deep Learning Framework)
ResNet18 (Pre-trained CNN Model)
HTML, CSS, JavaScript (Frontend)

## ðŸ“‚ Project Structure (Step-by-Step)

### 1. Backend Setup (`backend/`)
- **`app.py`**: This file contains the Flask backend code responsible for handling incoming requests and routing them to appropriate functions.
- **`load_model.py`**: This script loads and defines the CNN model (ResNet18) used for classification.
- **`preprocess.py`**: This file contains the code to preprocess input images, making them suitable for feeding into the model.
- **`model_weights.yaml`**: This file contains the pre-trained weights for the ResNet18 model.
- **`model.pkl`**: This serialized file contains the trained model that can be loaded for deployment.

### 2. Frontend Setup (`frontend/`)
- **`index.html`**: This is the main HTML file that defines the structure of the frontend user interface (UI).
- **`scripts.js`**: This JavaScript file contains the necessary code to handle the logic and user interactions for the frontend.
- **`styles.css`**: This file includes the CSS styles for designing the frontend to improve user experience.

### 3. Dataset Preparation (`dataset/`)
- **`images/`**: This folder contains the raw CT scan images used for training and testing the model.
- **`preprocessed_images/`**: This folder contains images that have been preprocessed, ready to be used for training or testing.
- **`split/`**: This folder contains images split into different datasetsâ€”`train/`, `test/`, and `val/` (validation) for model evaluation.

### 4. Project Documentation
- **`README.md`**: This file contains the documentation for the project, explaining the purpose, setup instructions, technologies used, and future improvements.

ðŸ§  Model Used

I utilize ResNet18, a deep learning model, to classify chest CT scan images. The model takes preprocessed images as input and outputs a numerical prediction value.

ðŸ“Š Prediction Output

The model provides a numerical output such as 733, 250, 323, etc. This value needs to be mapped to a meaningful classification, such as "COVID Positive" or "COVID Negative," in future updates.

ðŸš€ Future Improvements

Implement a threshold-based classification to return "COVID Positive" or "COVID Negative."
Improve frontend UI for better user experience.
Enhance preprocessing techniques for better model accuracy.
